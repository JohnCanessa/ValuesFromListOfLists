# ValuesFromListOfLists
Build in order list from various lists

In this problem we are given a set of lists that
contain integers from 0 to n - 1. No values are
duplicated. We need to generate a new list that
contains all the values in ascending order from
the values in the lists.

If interested in a better description of the problem,
my approach to solve it, and additional comments, I
invite you to read the following post in my blog:

to read and experiment. Practice makes perfect.
